                <p>
                    I was in a cave <br>
                    I was thinking in my dark grave<br>
                    Sometimes I saw the light in the end<br>
                    And I just wanted to be sent<br>
                    I ran every times<br>
                    I always did the climbs<br>
                    Just to arrive in the light<br>
                    In the middle of the eternal night<br>
                    But not once was real<br>
                    And I didn't know how to heal<br>
                    But this time seemed different<br>
                    And I was ignorant<br>
                    Just too late<br> 
                    I have tried to be straight<br>
                    I ran like I never ran<br>
                    More than I can<br>
                    The light was approaching<br>
                    I thought she was joking<br>
                    I thought everything would be fine<br>
                    But then came the decline<br>
                    And it gone away<br>
                    And everything started to be gray<br>
                    Then I really fell<br>
                    And I have screamed to the wall<br>
                    Now I am in the darkest cave <br>
                    Living on my own rage<br>
                    And sometimes I still see the light<br>
                    So smite<br>
                    I don't know if is a hallucination<br>
                    I close my eyes<br>
                    And wait to my damnation<br>        
                </p>
            </div>
