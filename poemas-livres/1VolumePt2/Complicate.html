                    <p>
                        I'm used to it <br>
                        Since I was a kid, things have always been like this<br>
                        People still creating problems with useless reasons<br>
                        Why so complicated?<br>
                        Soon every one of us will be dead<br>
                        No one will remeber us<br>
                        Tell me why all of you always complicate everything<br>
                        Fight for worthless teams<br>
                        Defending celebrities that don't give a fuck about u<br>
                        Because of fucking religions<br>
                        Because of politicians that only want your money<br>
                        Problems with our skin color<br>
                        The problem of humanity is creating big problems for small things<br>
                        They treat useless things as a priority<br>
                        And forgetting what really matters and making the fucking difference<br>
                        Seems like we like to live at war<br>
                        War between nations war between relationships<br>
                        Why do you always complicate everything?<br>
                    </p>
