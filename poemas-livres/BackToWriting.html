                    <p>
                        A long time ago <br>
                        The light came down to my words<br>
                        Let's ser if I will become again a writer of my disease <br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Time never was the same again<br>
                        Blaming the abstract <br>
                        Moving away the fault of me<br>
                        Each day I realize the more mortal we are<br>
                        Death and suffer walk in my left side<br>
                        And this way is how I gonna die <br>
                        Still today I inject poison in my veins<br>
                        (Inside)<br>
                        And I still do not care, I want fuckin more<br>
                        It's always was in my head<br>
                        The addiction is so huge<br>
                        Become the coolest stone<br>
                        So dead like your face in the worst day<br>
                        And I still don't care<br>
                        Put this neddle so deep like your deepest feelings<br>
                        First in the vein<br>
                        To go ti the heart and the brain<br>
                        I am not addicted in this fucking world out<br>
                        Each hour that pass I see how we are fallible <br>
                        This race has achieve the button of hate that I hided from everyone in my fuckin heart<br>
                        Tears and blood in my fuckin knife<br>
                        Like the sadness and hate in your fuckin day<br>
                        Calm always was a disguise to hide the despair inside<br>
                        Did you see how human you are in the choices that you choose?<br>
                        I want be far away all this dirty you call home<br>
                        And a medida que the night approxing <br>
                        Our hearts have to acostumad to be so fuckin alone <br>
                        Tears in our pillow<br>
                        Did you think that we are so different?<br>
                        The truth that I see infront my eyes makes me want kill myself <br>
                        My ying yang all white want to become fuckin black<br>
                        All that I see is<br>
                        Sin sin sin<br>
                        Sometimes I want not to help but be part of this filthy<br>
                        Oh God you will forgive me if I fuck over and over again?<br>
                        I don't care, my pillar was constructed by some people<br>
                        The same that are reading this <br>
                        And is with you that I have a bill to pay forever<br>
                        I will never stop to run in this ride of life<br>
                        You can make mistakes and fuck with me<br>
                        Play with me, walk up on me, put your fuckin knife down in my heart if you want<br>
                        Just tell me that you are happy now<br>
                        Because I know that nothing never will be enough to any of you<br>
                        I am addicted in hurt myself inside<br>
                        Inside myself hurt, fuck I want<br>
                        I swear that you will not realize<br>
                        But I need this poison in my veins<br>
                        And I still don't want to know if gonna hurt<br>
                        Fuck you I want more<br>
                        Most of you hold the scissor to cut ourselves<br>
                        But that's ok<br>
                        Because I just feel good when I am in shackles<br>
                    </p>
