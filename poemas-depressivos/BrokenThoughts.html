                <p>
                    I fell in love with a stripper <br>
                    But in the end she was a fucking ripper<br>
                    So in your face I'mma pull the damn trigger<br>
                    I cut myself when I'm lonely on my own<br>
                    They never ask nothing about me because they know <br>
                    That I never answer, let my blood flow<br>
                    I got demons on my ears <br>
                    I got future plans and blood tears<br>
                    They don't know about me<br>
                    She always cries when I leave<br>
                    I'mma give her the moon so she'll stab me in the back<br>
                    Some day I will never come back<br>
                    She ain't gonna never come back<br>
                    I can give you a rose but my heart would still be black<br>
                    While I'm alive I'll give her everything<br>
                    You should know that you and I don't know anything<br>
                    Everything is more than our limited finitude can absorb<br>
                    Alone on the porch smoking<br>
                    I study the complexity of the universe while I think about killing myself, I'm not joking<br>
                    Recently I'm seeing everything gray<br>
                    I know there is no other way<br>
                    Believing in a false religion is what makes them see the shine in the day<br>
                    I want you to smoke me while there's time<br>
                    I'mma live calculating my brushes while I die<br>
                    I'mma die, I never ask for help<br>
                    I can never make mistakes or cry<br>
                    There's so much I don't know<br>
                    I'll find out as much as possible while I'm alive<br>
                    Isn't she beautiful?<br>
                    She left me to die alone tonight<br>
                    I'm kissing her while I think we'll soon be rotting underground<br>
                    I'm not confident, I wasn't enough<br>
                    That's why she left me to die tonight<br>
                    She ain't gonna come back<br>
                    I'm happy to know that no one close to me felt the kind of pain I felt<br>
                    My heart is in melt<br>
                    I ain't never gonna talk about it, my arm it's in melt<br>
                    But still I'll find the way to your heart<br>
                    I have medicine in my body, cuts in my arm and here comes the train<br>
                    The time has come to end this pain<br>
                    She left me to die again<br>
                    Girls always leave me to die with my pain<br>
                </p>
