                <p>
                    One more night awake <br>
                    Waiting for a call you won't make<br>
                    Sending messages, trying to call<br>
                    I can't stand looking at the wall<br>
                    I think I'm losing my mind<br>
                    My sanity is completely blind<br>
                    You treat this as a joke<br>
                    Always disappears in the smoke<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why don't you pick up the phone?<br>
                    Do not think that I am done<br>
                    Why don't you pick up the phone?<br>
                    Tonight, I am dying on my own<br>
                </p>            

                <p>
                    Let me alone to die tonight<br>
                    Or give me some of your light<br>
                    No matter how much I call<br>
                    I will continue in the fall<br>
                    I am running to you<br>
                    But you're running away from me<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Why don't you pick up the phone?<br>
                    Do not think that I am done<br>
                    Why don't you pick up the phone?<br>
                    Tonight, I am dying on my own<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Always an excuse<br>
                    You like to abuse<br>
                    My demon showing me images I don't want to see<br>
                    You do not have time for me<br>
                    It's fine, I will be on my own<br>
                    Cause you never pick up the phone<br>
                    I have a trauma, tonight I'm done<br>
                </p>
