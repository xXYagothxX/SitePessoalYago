                <p>
                    Moon in the sky, we walk with dead souls <br>
                    Replace me now with all your depth blows<br>
                    Living deads with a little sanity<br>
                    Your room is quiet with your agony<br>
                    There is blood on our hands and false cheers<br>
                    My glasses blurred with all my tears<br>
                    My dead eyes seeing blood coming out of your veins<br>
                    Tired of these nightmares while I'm awake<br>
                    Waiting for the call which one you'll never make <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please don't hurt yourself<br>
                    Many people will do it for you (Hate)<br>
                    Please don't hurt yourself<br>
                    Dump your guilt on me, I can carry your weight<br>
                    Please don't hurt yourself<br>
                    Bury me coldly, you know this is my fate<br>
                </p>            

                <p>
                    I cheated everyone, I'm in a mind chain<br>
                    Because I am still looking for pain<br>
                    My cuts were replaced by images, it's a curse<br>
                    I look around and I think it's worse<br>
                    The Everest on my back<br>
                    I can't be imperfect and have a crack<br>
                    Never having time to breathe or err<br>
                    Corpse on the table with papers, life is unfair<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Please don't hurt yourself<br>
                    Sorry, I tried to help but I'm useless<br>
                    Please don't hurt yourself<br>
                    Just remember me and don't fall into loneliness<br>
                    Please don't hurt yourself<br>
                    I let you hurt me instead, I'm harmless<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm producing and working hard while you're disappeared<br>
                    When I die, you'll see everything, my thoughts are uncleared<br>
                    Let my memories and brain feed the bugs<br>
                    Sometimes when I'm sad, you don't even give me a hug<br>
                    Just do not hurt yourself when I'm dead<br>
                    Because I'm always worried about you in my head<br>
                </p>
